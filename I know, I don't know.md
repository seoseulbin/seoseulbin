Explaining what I learned and what I am still confused about.

I learned about computer and principle in webs and games. 
Various computer languages was unfamiliar to me. So sometimes, I was so tired to understand and do assignment.
But I always trying, now I was gradually getting interesting used to adapted. :relieved:

However, it is still a bit difficult to me to come up with an idea without much experience with coding.
I am trying to study more than I have tried so far. 
And I'm trying to get habit of thinking in various ways. :wink:
