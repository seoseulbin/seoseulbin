Explaining what I learned and what I am still confused about.

I learned about computer and principle in webs and games. 
Various computer languages was unfamiliar to me. So sometimes, I was so tired to understand and do assignment.
But I am always trying, now I am gradually getting used to understand using it. :relieved:

However, it is still a bit difficult for me to come up with not having the idea about coding.
I am trying to study more than I have eber tried before.
And I'm trying to get habit of thinking in various ways. :wink:
